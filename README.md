Hudson yards is a newly built business center in NYC attracting numerous people for shopping, entertainment etc. In Lab 1, we will aggregate taxi flows to Hudson yards and investigate potential correlated factors. By going through the tutorial, we will get some basic skills of urban analytics - data analysis, spatial mapping, data visualization, ect. Have fun!
